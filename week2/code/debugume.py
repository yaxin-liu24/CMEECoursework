def buggyfunc(x):
    """
    A function that attempts to perform some calculations by decreasing a variable y 
    and dividing x by y in each iteration of a loop. The function returns the last calculated 
    value of z. 

    Args:
    x (int): The input integer for the loop, and the value used in the division calculations.

    Returns:
    float: The last value of z after the loop finishes, which is x divided by the final value of y.

    Example:
    buggyfunc(20) 
    # This will return a float value representing the division of 20 by the final value of y after the loop.

        z = x / y
