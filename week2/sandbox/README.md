    WEEK2 practicals in python

Brief description: 

    This folder is mainly for some code draft and simple tests.
    
Languages: 

    Python (3.0)

Dependencies: 

    ipdb (for debugging)
    os: provides a way to use operating system-dependent functionality, such as file path manipulation and directory creation.
    sys: This module provides access to command-line arguments and system-specific parameters.
    re: This module is used for regular expression operations, allowing pattern matching in strings.
    csv: This module provides functionality for reading from and writing to CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.
    pickle: This module is imported, which allows you to serialize (convert an object into a byte stream) and deserialize (convert a byte stream back into an object) Python objects.

Installation: Guidelines for installing the project (if applicable), including dependencies.

    1.Clone the repository
    2.Navigate to the project directory
    3.Install the dependencies if required

Project structure and Usage: 

    basic_io3.py: The code demonstrates how to use the pickle module to save a Python dictionary to a file in binary format and then load it back into a Python program.

    cfexercises2.py: Each function demonstrates different control flow constructs in Python, such as loops (for, while) and conditionals (if, elif).

    comprehensions.py: shows how to modify each string in a list to be lowercase using a loop that iterates over the indices of the list.
    
    control_flow.py: This script serves as an educational example of using control statements in Python, demonstrating how to define and utilize functions with default parameters, conditional statements, and loops.
    
    debugume.py: The function buggyfunc as originally written will raise a ZeroDivisionError due to an attempt to divide by zero. It can be fixed by ensuring that the loop does not allow y to reach zero, either by adjusting the loop's range or adding a condition to handle the division more safely.
    
    loops.py: The function foo correctly squares the input, prints the result, and returns it. The usage of return allows the caller to store the output, which is demonstrated by assigning the return value to the variable y.
    
    oaks.py: Each section prints a set of species names, either as they are or in uppercase, depending on the specific code block. The use of sets ensures that there are no duplicate entries in the output.
