    Bootcamp practices with shell script, python and R

Brief description: 

    week1 focused on basic UNIX programming practice and shell scripting exercises. 
    week2 focused on improving coding skills through hands-on tasks.
    week3 focused on data Processing and exploration: master the principles of data processing, exploration, and visualization using R.


Languages: 

    UNIX Command and Shell script
    Python (3.0)
    R version 4.3.3 

Dependencies: 

    packages:
        
        For Python:
        
        ipdb (for debugging)
        os: provides a way to use operating system-dependent functionality, such as file path manipulation and directory creation.
        sys: This module provides access to command-line arguments and system-specific parameters.
        re: This module is used for regular expression operations, allowing pattern matching in strings.
        csv: This module provides functionality for reading from and writing to CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.

        For R:

        dplyr: A grammar of data manipulation, providing a set of functions to help you transform and summarize data. 
        tidyverse: It is a collection of R packages designed for data science. It shares a common philosophy and syntax, making it easier to learn and use. Key packages within the Tidyverse include dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, readr, and others.
        qpplot: It is not one of the most widely known packages, and it may refer to a specific function or a less common package
        ggplot: It is a powerful and versatile visualization package in R, part of the Tidyverse. It implements the Grammar of Graphics, allowing users to create complex and multi-layered graphics in a systematic way
