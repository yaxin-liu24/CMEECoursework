# cat: reads the contents of the file and sends it to the terminal
# | : takes the output of the command on its left and uses it as input for the command on its right.
# tail is a command that outputs the last part of a file. 
# The "-n +2" option tells tail to start outputting from line 2 onward (it skips the first line)

# grep: searches for occurrences of the string 
# -o: tells grep to only output the matched parts, one per line.
