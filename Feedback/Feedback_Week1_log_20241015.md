# Feedback on Project Structure and Code

## Project Structure

### Repository Organization
The repository is well-structured with a clear separation of `code`, `data`, `results`, and `sandbox` directories. This is a good practice that ensures clarity and ease of navigation. However, the absence of a `.gitignore` file is notable. Adding one would prevent unnecessary files (such as system-specific files or results) from being tracked in version control.

### README Files
The `README.md` file in the root directory provides a basic description of the repository. However, it lacks important details such as usage instructions for the scripts, expected input and output formats, and system requirements. The README in the `week1` directory provides some context but could also be expanded with more specific information on how to run the scripts and what data they require.

## Workflow
The workflow is well-organized, with clear separation between code, data, and results. The results directory contains only a `README.md` file, which is a good practice since output files should generally not be tracked. However, it would be helpful to include more detailed explanations in the README files about how to generate the results and store them properly.

## Code Syntax & Structure

### Shell Scripts
1. **csvtospace.sh:**
   - The script converts CSV files to space-separated values. It includes input validation and handles file existence checks well. However, there is a missing `usage` function, which causes an error when the wrong number of arguments is provided:
     ```bash
     csvtospace.sh: line 13: usage: command not found
     ```
   - You can add a simple usage function at the top of the script to resolve this:
     ```bash
     usage() {
         echo "Usage: $0 <input_file.csv>"
         exit 1
     }
     ```

2. **variables.sh:**
   - The script runs without issues. It demonstrates basic usage of shell variables and does not require further improvements.

3. **CountLines.sh:**
   - This script counts the number of lines in a file, and the logic works correctly. However, it also suffers from the missing `usage` function error. Adding a usage function similar to the one suggested for `csvtospace.sh` would resolve this issue.

4. **tiff2png.sh:**
   - The script does not produce any errors, but it would benefit from more comments explaining its functionality. Adding comments would make the script more readable, especially for others unfamiliar with the logic.

5. **tabtocsv.sh:**
   - The script converts tab-separated files to CSV. Similar to other scripts, it lacks a usage function, which leads to an error when no arguments are provided. The input validation could be improved by moving the check for input arguments to the start of the script.

6. **UnixPrac1.txt:**
   - This script performs various tasks on `.fasta` files, such as counting lines and calculating the AT/GC ratio. The script runs without issues but would benefit from more detailed comments explaining each command. This would make the script easier to understand for users who are unfamiliar with Unix commands or bioinformatics workflows.

7. **MyExampleScript.sh:**
   - A simple script that prints a greeting using the `$USER` environment variable. It runs without errors and is clear and concise.

8. **ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh:**
   - This script concatenates two input files and saves the result in the `results` directory. The input validation works well, but it would benefit from checking if the output file already exists to prevent overwriting without warning.

## Suggestions for Improvement
- **Error Handling:** Many scripts would benefit from additional error handling, particularly around checking for the existence of input files and directories before proceeding, and preventing file overwrites without warning.
- **Usage Functions:** Several scripts lack a `usage` function, leading to errors when arguments are missing or incorrect. Adding these functions would make the scripts more user-friendly.
- **Comments:** More detailed comments in the scripts (particularly `UnixPrac1.txt` and `tiff2png.sh`) would make the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **README Enhancements:** Expanding the README files with usage examples, expected input/output formats, and any dependencies would improve usability for external users.

## Overall Feedback
The project is well-organized, and the scripts are functional. With improvements in error handling, the addition of usage functions, and more detailed comments, the scripts would be more robust and user-friendly. The README files could also be enhanced to provide clearer instructions for users unfamiliar with the project. Overall, the work demonstrates a good understanding of shell scripting and project organization.
