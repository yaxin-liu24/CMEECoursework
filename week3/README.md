    WEEK3 practicals with R

Brief description: 

    This project is designed to focuses on practicing Basic R Syntax to understand the fundamental syntax and programming conventions of R, starting from the ground up; data Processing and exploration: master the principles of data processing, exploration, and visualization using R to uncover insights from datasets.Enhance the efficiency of your R simulations by leveraging vectorization techniques.

Languages: 

    R version 4.3.3 

Dependencies: 

    packages:
        dplyr: A grammar of data manipulation, providing a set of functions to help you transform and summarize data. 
        tidyverse: It is a collection of R packages designed for data science. It shares a common philosophy and syntax, making it easier to learn and use. Key packages within the Tidyverse include dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, readr, and others.
        qpplot: It is not one of the most widely known packages, and it may refer to a specific function or a less common package
        ggplot: It is a powerful and versatile visualization package in R, part of the Tidyverse. It implements the Grammar of Graphics, allowing users to create complex and multi-layered graphics in a systematic way
